5.Run 'npm install' from CMD in home directory where package file is present, to install the necessary packages.
6.You can start the app with 'npm start' from the CMD in the home directory.

Optionally you can use 'npm run build' to generate a build to use it in hosting.


Note: While hosting on Heroku, you need to create a Procfile in the home project directory. Similar things have to followed when hosting on different sites. This project is a Reactjs Based CounterApp project.

Screenshots have been added in the home directory after the successful testing in local host.
